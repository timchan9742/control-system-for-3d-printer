# Control System for 3D Printer

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for a robust Python-based control system designed specifically for managing the operations of a self-developed 3D printer. The control system serves as the intermediary, ensuring seamless communication between the printer hardware and the web interfaces([see here](https://github.com/timchan9742/web-interface-for-3d-printer)).

## Features

- **Efficient Command Handling**: The control system efficiently handles commands from the web interface, ensuring timely execution and precise control over printer operations.

- **Hardware Interaction**: Direct interaction with printer hardware components, including motors, sensors, and heating elements, enables precise control over printer movements and environmental conditions.

- **Error Handling and Recovery**: Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to detect and mitigate issues during printing, minimizing downtime and ensuring reliable performance.

- **Configurability**: The control system offers extensive configurability options, allowing users to specify and change printer settings. 

## Getting Started

To set up the 3D printer control system locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install any necessary dependencies.
4. Change the settings in the config file under the /configs folder.
5. Run main.py.
